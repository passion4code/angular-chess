# AngularChess

I wanted to dip my toes in the Angular waters, so I decided to make a simple chess game. 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.2.

## Local Setup

To get started locally, make sure NodeJS and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) are both installed, and run the following commands from your terminal

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`

## @TODO

1. Implement "player turns"
1. Restrict movement of pieces to only go where they are legally allowed
1. Implement graveyard
1. Implement logic for pawn reaching end space
1. Determine check vs check mate
1. Provide ability to reset game in UI
1. Basic multiplayer support
